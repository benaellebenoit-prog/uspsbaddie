 # USPS Digtal Offerings Eval

 USPS Digital Offerings Evaluation

 USPS Business Platforms: For medium-large shippers, USPS has tools like the Business Customer Gateway (BCG) portal and Click-N-Ship® Business Pro (a downloadable software for high-volume label printing). The BCG, which provides access to services like USPS APIs, postage payment (eVS), and bulk mail entry, was updated in recent years to be more user-friendly[uspsdelivers.com](https://www.uspsdelivers.com/start-with-business-customer-gateway/#:~:text=A%20101%20Guide%20to%20the,Full). Even so, newcomers often find it confusing to navigate the array of services and obtain the necessary IDs (CRIDs, MIDs, permits). The onboarding can involve multiple steps (registering on BCG, applying for specific services, possibly getting a USPS sales rep if volume warrants). In 2014 USPS touted “simplified onboarding … in as little as 15 minutes” for Business Pro via the BCG[about.usps.com](https://about.usps.com/publications/annual-report-comprehensive-statement-2014/annual-report-comprehensive-statement-v2-2014.pdf#:~:text=,as%20little%20as%2015), but small businesses still report challenges understanding USPS’s various programs (like Commercial Plus vs. Commercial Base pricing, or how to qualify for Merchant Rate discounts).

 Click-N-Ship Business Pro: This free software (PC-only) lets businesses batch-print labels and access commercial rates without a paid vendor. It’s a commendable offering, but adoption seems limited. Some Reddit users weren’t even aware it exists, and those who tried it have noted it’s not as polished as private shipping software. For example, there is no Mac version and it requires installation and regular updates, whereas competitors offer web-based solutions. One Reddit thread from an eBay seller a decade ago asked if Business Pro would let them print First Class postage for free (to avoid stamps.com fees)[reddit.com](https://www.reddit.com/r/USPS/comments/1eoboif/clicknship_business_rate_card_and_save/#:~:text=%2A%20%20Click,class%20postage%20online%20for%20free)[reddit.com](https://www.reddit.com/r/USPS/comments/1eoboif/clicknship_business_rate_card_and_save/#:~:text=Members) – an indication that cost-conscious small businesses want USPS-provided tools, but in practice many still end up using third-party services for better UX. An OIG report to Congress highlighted that Business Pro and USPS Web Tools are aimed at higher-volume business users, but USPS faces stiff competition from third-party integrators offering more features[supplychaindive.com](https://www.supplychaindive.com/news/us-postal-service-merchant-postage-rates-oig/752981/#:~:text=Multicarrier%20shipping%20platforms%20like%20Shippo%2C,could%20secure%20on%20their%20own). Indeed, USPS’s own SEC filings acknowledge these solutions are meant to keep large mailers from defecting to alternatives[annualreports.com](https://www.annualreports.com/HostedData/AnnualReports/PDF/NASDAQ_STMP_2020.pdf#:~:text=%5BPDF%5D%20Stamps.com%20Inc.%20,in%20the%20United%20States). The bottom line is that while USPS has digital tools for businesses, the user experience often lags. Many businesses choose multi-carrier platforms (ShipStation, Shopify Shipping, etc.) for a smoother workflow – benefiting USPS only indirectly – rather than wrestling with USPS’s native tools.

 Account Setup & Onboarding: A business’s first interaction is often setting up a USPS business account or shipping software. While creating a basic online account at USPS.com is easy, obtaining higher-volume services (like bulk mail permits or API access) is more involved. Businesses must navigate the Business Customer Gateway for permits, USPS Web Tools API registration, or enroll in programs like Click-N-Ship Commercial. Some users find the process opaque – for instance, understanding how to get Commercial Base rates via Click-N-Ship or how to qualify for USPS Connect Local (a same-day delivery service for businesses) can require digging through USPS’s website. On the positive side, USPS does not charge for tools that some private carriers or agents do. There’s no fee to create an account, use the API, or deploy Business Pro, which is appealing for cost-conscious shippers. USPS also provides free shipping supplies (boxes, envelopes) for many services, and as one OIG paper noted, it has a post office in practically every community – assets that should make onboarding attractive[uspsoig.gov](https://www.uspsoig.gov/sites/default/files/reports/2023-01/RISC-WP-23-001.pdf#:~:text=Executive%20Summary%20Small%20businesses%20are,every%20community%20in%20the%20country)[uspsoig.gov](https://www.uspsoig.gov/sites/default/files/reports/2023-01/RISC-WP-23-001.pdf#:~:text=offering%20a%20bevy%20of%20affordable,offers%20some%20ideas%20for%20new). The challenge is making businesses aware of and comfortable with these resources. (USPS has begun marketing to small businesses via its USPS Delivers educational site and local outreach; consistency in messaging is still an area for improvement

 Daily Shipping Operations: Once onboard, businesses interface with USPS daily through pickups, drop-offs, and label printing. Here, convenience and reliability are paramount, and USPS has mixed performance:

 * Pickups: USPS offers free next-day pickup for packages (unlike UPS/FedEx, which often charge a pickup fee for one-off or require a daily pickup contract)[play.google.com](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.usps.app&hl=en_US#:~:text=%E2%80%A2%20Look%20up%20a%20ZIP,or%20Canadian%20address). This is a delight factor for many small businesses – being able to schedule a mail carrier to collect outgoing parcels at no extra cost. However, reliability issues undermine it. Numerous anecdotes describe carriers missing scheduled pickups, or taking only some packages and leaving others. On forums and even USPS’s own Facebook posts, users ask, “Anyone having issues with USPS scheduled pickup?” and trade stories – some have great mail carriers who never miss a pickup, while others have resorted to daily post office runs after too many no-shows[community.ebay.com](https://community.ebay.com/t5/Shipping/USPS-keeps-forgetting-to-pick-up-my-packages/td-p/28522248#:~:text=USPS%20keeps%20forgetting%20to%20pick,You%20will%20need)[facebook.com](https://www.facebook.com/groups/136461779799902/posts/3467248080054572/#:~:text=USPS%20package%20pickup%20scheduling%20issues,experiences%20to%20share%3F%20Thank%20you). When a pickup is missed, the business often scrambles to drop off items or they go out a day late, potentially breaching customer delivery promises. The inconsistency of this service (highly dependent on the local postal worker and office) is a pain point.  
 * Label Generation: Small businesses shipping a few packages a day might use the USPS website’s Click-N-Ship tool to print labels. This works fine for low volume, but it supports only one label at a time (no batch printing on the web interface). For higher volume, USPS directs users to Business Pro or approved third-party software. The fragmentation here can be confusing: some start with Click-N-Ship, then “outgrow” it and must learn a new system. The Business Pro software, as mentioned, is functional but not user-centric by modern standards. Many enterprise shippers instead use integrated solutions (e.g. printing USPS labels directly from Shopify, Etsy, PayPal, or warehouse management systems). Those interfaces are often better – but when they malfunction, the business may have to troubleshoot with multiple parties (USPS, the software vendor, etc.). It’s noteworthy that an OIG study found technical issues in multi-carrier software (like improper rate calculations) led to USPS postage overcharges and potential loss of business[supplychaindive.com](https://www.supplychaindive.com/news/us-postal-service-merchant-postage-rates-oig/752981/#:~:text=,choose%20from%20multiple%20delivery%20providers)[supplychaindive.com](https://www.supplychaindive.com/news/us-postal-service-merchant-postage-rates-oig/752981/#:~:text=led%20to%20instances%20of%20users,the%20OIG%20said). So if USPS’s own label tools aren’t meeting needs, and third-party tools introduce errors, business shippers are essentially stuck in the middle bearing the inconvenience or cost.

 Tracking & Visibility: For a business sending hundreds of packages, being able to monitor delivery status is critical (to proactively address problems). USPS’s tracking system is generally robust in scans, but getting an aggregate view is not straightforward. There is no native “dashboard” for all outgoing shipments unless you use the enterprise-level tools (e.g. Informed Visibility for mailers, which is more for mail pieces than packages). Most SMBs rely on third-party tracking dashboards or the tracking CSV reports from shipping software. If using USPS.com or the mobile app, you can only check tracking one number at a time (or save a handful of items to a list). This is less convenient than UPS/FedEx account portals, which offer business customers a consolidated view of all shipments and exceptions. Moreover, when something goes wrong (package stuck “In Transit” for days), USPS often provides sparse info. Reddit users have bemoaned the “In Transit, Arriving Late” limbo with no estimated date, while they field customer calls helplessly[reddit.com](https://www.reddit.com/r/usps_complaints/comments/q4mcyz/has_anyone_had_any_luck_escalating_cases_to/#:~:text=Has%20anyone%20had%20any%20luck,message). Some businesses have developed workarounds – e.g. subscribing to Informed Delivery for destination addresses to see if a package gets a delivery scan, or paying for services like AfterShip to get better tracking analytics. This is an area where USPS could improve the journey by offering better tracking tools for business senders (not just recipients).

 Channel Switching: A key observation is that business customers often must hop between channels to get their task done, indicating USPS’s customer experience is not unified. For example, a business might start by checking tracking on the website, then realize they need to request an investigation – which can’t be done in the app, so they call the 800-number. After not hearing back, they might message the USPS Facebook (social media) and eventually end up visiting the post office in person. This fragmented journey is taxing. The Postal Service itself recognizes the value of omnichannel integration (as noted by industry research[uspsoig.gov](https://www.uspsoig.gov/reports/audit-reports/social-media-customer-inquiries#:~:text=that%20social%20media%20users%20expect,provide%20a%20consistent%20customer%20experience)), but from a user standpoint in 2025, USPS’s channels often feel siloed. Information doesn’t seamlessly carry over – the customer must re-explain their issue each time. Contrast this with, say, UPS, where a shipper can open a claim online and then any phone agent can see that claim status. USPS is making incremental improvements (for instance, tying online complaint case numbers to your account login), but these are behind modern CX standards. The result is many business shippers “channel hop” out of frustration: e.g. if the website fails, try the app; if the app fails, call; if the call center can’t help, drive to the post office. This behavior is a symptom of USPS not fully understanding or mapping the business customer journey across touchpoints.

 Enterprise shortcoming :No Real-Time Negotiated Contracts

 * Unlike FedEx/UPS, USPS doesn’t negotiate dynamic contract rates based on volume, performance, or SLA penalties.  
 * Enterprise customers may miss the flexible pricing tiers and rebates they get elsewhere.

 enterprise/bulk shipping wins : 1\. Last-Mile Delivery Dominance

 * USPS delivers to 163 million addresses daily—including PO boxes and rural areas other carriers don’t reach affordably.  
 * Even large carriers like FedEx and UPS rely on USPS for “last mile” through programs like Parcel Select.

 2\. Cost-Efficient for Lightweight Bulk

 * USPS offers Commercial Plus Pricing (CPP) for high-volume shippers.  
 * Their cubic pricing model (under Priority Mail Commercial) rewards companies that ship small but heavy items in bulk.

 3\. USPS Connect™ for Bulk & Local Delivery

 * Designed for high-volume business customers.  
 * Offers same-day or next-day local delivery, deep discounts for presorted mail and packages, and scheduled pickups.

 USPS  Functionality and Channel Switching Issues  
 For a small business monitoring mail and packages, the app fails at critical points and often forces users out of the native app experience:

 • Tracking Limitations: The tracking section "only let's me track one package at a time". This limitation is a significant drawback for businesses managing high shipping or receiving volumes.

 • Informed Delivery Failure: Users attempting to access Informed Delivery are redirected, as the button "brings me to the website" or "opens a freakin browser window". This required channel switching interrupts workflow and may force users to log in again on the separate browser window.  
 • Tracking Input Failures: When users try to copy and paste a tracking number, "nothing will happen," sometimes without any error messages to indicate the problem.  
 📉 Performance and Technical Reliability

 The core technical performance of the app severely limits its usefulness, making it inconvenient and potentially harmful to time-sensitive business operations:

 • Error Screens and Load Times: Users report that the app "barely works at all now".  
 • When attempting to track a package, the app displays a white screen for up to 3 minutes before throwing an error message.  
 • Trust and Utility: The app's poor performance means that, in its current state, users feel "it's not even worth downloading".

 Mobile App takeaway

 Login Experience and Security Friction  
 The current login procedure presents a high level of friction that impedes efficiency, especially for businesses that need to frequently check their delivery status:

 • Mandatory Multi-Step Login: Users are forced to enter both their username and password every single time they wish to access services like Informed Delivery.

 • Constant Authentication: This is followed by a delay to wait for a multi-factor authentication code—again, required "every single time".

 • Lack of Modern Features: There is no option for biometric login or even a simple PIN, frustrating users who expect faster, more convenient access from a mobile application.  
 • Overall Usability: The process is described as turning a simple, useful tool into a "complicated mess".

 # Landscape Website Eval and Hypothesis


 **UPS website hierarchy** : Global business-centric focus. “discover fast, reliable global shipping and logistics solutions”[highergov.com](https://www.highergov.com/awardee/united-parcel-service-uae-l-l-c-10040326/#:~:text=Company%20Description), signaling emphasis on speed and worldwide reach.  UPS as a logistics partner for businesses (“streamline your supply chain” messaging[highergov.com](https://www.highergov.com/awardee/united-parcel-service-uae-l-l-c-10040326/#:~:text=Company%20Description)), with tools for shipping, tracking, and supply chain management front and center. Marketing materials stress innovation and customer focus (“Customer First, People Led, Innovation Driven” ethos[about.ups.com](https://about.ups.com/us/en/our-company.html#:~:text=Customer%20First%2C%20People%20Led%2C%20Innovation,people%20led%20and%20innovation%20driven)), and campaigns like “Proudly Unstoppable” spotlight support for small businesses[about.ups.com](https://about.ups.com/us/en/our-stories/customer-first/proudly-unstoppable-global.html#:~:text=proudly%20unstoppable%20global%20,UPS%20has%20partnered) –  UPS wants to be seen as reliable,  forwardthinking, and customer first.

 **Brand promise hypothesis**:"customer first, people led", fast and reliable. HUMAN T**he most dependable and innovative logistics partner.** UPS implies it will “deliver what matters” (a core slogan[about.ups.com](https://about.ups.com/us/en/our-stories/customer-first/ups-purpose-taps-into-the-very-heart-of-our-dna.html#:~:text=%E2%80%9CThis%20is%20our%20anthem,as%20she%20introduced%20UPS%E2%80%99s%20purpose)) by combining a vast network with cutting-edge solutions and a customer-first approach.

 **Actual customer experience** : Recurring delivery failures and poor support.  Reviews speak of packages delayed or stuck for days (“out for delivery” status frozen in limbo[trustpilot.com](https://www.trustpilot.com/review/www.ups.com#:~:text=Corrine%20Blade%206%20days%20ago)) and even shipments sitting in a warehouse for weeks without movement[trustpilot.com](https://www.trustpilot.com/review/www.ups.com#:~:text=Image%3A%20Rated%201%20out%20of,5%20stars). Tracking issues are common – users find scans and updates that “made zero sense”[trustpilot.com](https://www.trustpilot.com/review/www.ups.com#:~:text=Image%3A%20Rated%201%20out%20of,5%20stars) or false alerts (packages marked delivered or “address inaccessible” when they were not). Crucially, customer service frustrates users: it’s described as “HORRIBLE. NON-EXISTENT”, with no human resolution as UPS has “gone AI-automated”[trustpilot.com](https://www.trustpilot.com/review/www.ups.com#:~:text=Image%3A%20Rated%201%20out%20of,5%20stars) – directly clashing with the “customer first” claim. Small businesses report chaos as well: one store owner described “absolute chaos with UPS… every delivery is a problem,” including drivers leaving packages on a city sidewalk (against policy) resulting in theft[reddit.com](https://www.reddit.com/r/UPS/comments/1l2ny0l/small_business_constant_problems_with_deliveries/#:~:text=We%20have%20a%20small%20business,to%20leave%20packages%20outside%20businesses). These anecdotes reflect broader consensus: dissatisfaction is systemic
